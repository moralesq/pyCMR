# pyCMR
Python Functions for Cardiac Magnetic Resonance

The purpose of this project is to provide python implementations of various processing functions useful in CMR. Since data structures will inevitably vary between scanners, sequences, and acquisitions, this is a long iterative endeavor that will require many iterations as new data instances are encountered. 

## Ongoing development
- Conversion of arbitrary raw dicom data (e.g., SSFP, T1, T2, etc) to arbitrary data formats (e.g., .mat, .nii.gz, etc)
